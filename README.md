# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React.js. This project demonstrates the use of React hooks and state management to create an interactive game interface.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player
- Generate AI moves
- Reset the game board
- Display game result

## Components

- `Grid`: The main game component
- `GameOver`: Component to display the game result
- `TicTacToe.js`: Contains game logic functions

## Usage

- Click on a tile to make a move
- Use the "generate move" button to let the AI make a move
- Click "reset" to start a new game

## Future fixes 

- Need to keep improving React Component code to make more readable and efficeint
- code simplify some game logic in logic from TicTacToe.js
